# Clustering Analysis and Algorithm Performance Evaluation

## Overview
This project focuses on clustering analysis using various algorithms (K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN) on a given dataset. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, detect outliers, and optimize the clustering process through hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation**: 
  - Data scaling and preprocessing to prepare for clustering analysis.
  
- **Clustering Algorithms**: 
  - Implementation of K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
  
- **Evaluation and Visualization**: 
  - Visualization of clustering results using PCA for 2D representation.
  - Evaluation of algorithms using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.
  
- **Outlier Detection**:
  - Identification of outliers using the DBSCAN algorithm.
  
- **Improvisation**:
  - Comparison of the performance metrics for all clustering algorithms.
  - Suggestions for improving the overall experiment.
